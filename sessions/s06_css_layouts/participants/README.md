# Participant Solutions

## Instructions

1. Create a new folder with your name or username inside this directory
2. Copy the following files from the `tasks` directory to your folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `base.css`
   - `task.css` (rename this to your own solution file, e.g., `solution.css`)

3. Work on the tasks in your own folder, implementing your solutions
4. Once completed, you can compare your solutions with the reference implementation

## Example Structure

```
participants/
  john/
    index.html
    base.css
    john-solution.css
  sarah/
    index.html
    base.css
